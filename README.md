## Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## Current State of Repo
We are currently aware of the backlog for this repo and are working to address this.  Please be aware that if you have any updates to automatically generated reference content, you should create an issue and not a PR.  The issue will then be created into a bug and triaged accordingly.  We do this because the reference content must mirror the &#42;dll-help.xml file and subsequent updates to the reference content may overwrite any changes made through the repo.  Capturing it in the source code ensures that this does not occur.  Any PR with changes to automatically generated reference content will be closed.  

Automatically generated reference content is any of the content under this Reference node, such as [Get-AzureADUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/AzureAD/Get-AzureADUser?view=azureadps-2.0)

This only applies to reference content and not conceptual content.  Pull requests for changes to conceptual content are accepted and encouraged.  An example of the conceptual content is the [Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview?view=azureadps-2.0) or a scenario such as [importing data](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/active-directory/importing-data?view=azureadps-2.0).

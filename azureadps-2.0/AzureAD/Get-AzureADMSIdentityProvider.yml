  This cmdlet is used to retrieve the identity providers that have been configured in the directory.
  These identity providers can be used to allow users to sign up for or sign into applications secured by Azure AD B2C.

  Configuring an identity provider in your Azure AD tenant also enables future B2B guest scenarios.
  For example, an organization has resources in Office 365 that needs to be shared with a Gmail user.
  The Gmail user will use their Google account credentials to authenticate and access the documents.

  The current set of identity providers can be Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, or LinkedIn.

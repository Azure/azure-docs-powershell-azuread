description: |-
  The **Convert-MsolDomainToStandard** cmdlet converts the specified domain from single sign-on (also known as identity federation) to standard authentication.
  Single sign-on is also known as identity federation.

  This process also removes the relying party trust settings in the Active Directory Federation Services 2.0 server and Microsoft Online.

  After the conversion, this cmdlet converts all existing users from single sign-on to standard authentication.
  Any existing user who was configured for single sign-on gets a new temporary password as part of the conversion process.
  Each converted user name and new temporary password is recorded in a file for reference by the administrator.
  The administrator can then distribute the new temporary password to each converted user to enable the user to sign in to Microsoft Online Services.

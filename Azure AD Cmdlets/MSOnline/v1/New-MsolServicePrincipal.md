# New-MsolServicePrincipal

## SYNOPSIS
Adds a service principal to Azure Active Directory.

## SYNTAX

```
New-MsolServicePrincipal [-ServicePrincipalNames <String[]>] [-AppPrincipalId <Guid>] -DisplayName <String>
 [-AccountEnabled <Boolean>] [-Addresses <RedirectUri[]>] [-Type <ServicePrincipalCredentialType>]
 [-Value <String>] [-StartDate <DateTime>] [-EndDate <DateTime>] [-Usage <ServicePrincipalCredentialUsage>]
 [-TenantId <Guid>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **New-MsolServicePrincipal** cmdlet creates a service principal that can be used to represent a Line Of Business (LOB) application or an on-premises server such as Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint or Lync in Microsoft Azure Active Directory as service principal objects.
Adding a new application as a service principal allows that application to authenticate to other services such as Microsoft Office 365.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Create a service principal
```
PS C:\> New-MsolServicePrincipal -ServicePrincipalNames @("MyApp/myApp.com") -DisplayName "My Application"
```

This command creates a service principal.
In this example, the service principal is created with the service principal name MyApp/myApp.com, the display name My Application, and will use an auto-generated 256 bit symmetric key to verify the application.
This key will be valid for a year from today.

### Example 2: Create a service principal that uses an X509 certificate
```
PS C:\> $cer = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate
PS C:\> $cer.Import("C:\temp\myapp.cer")
PS C:\> $binCert = $cer.GetRawCertData()
PS C:\> $credValue = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($binCert);
PS C:\> New-MsolServicePrincipal -ServicePrincipalNames @("MyApp/myApp.com") -DisplayName "My Application" -Type asymmetric -Value $credValue
```

This example creates a service principal.
In this example, the service principal is created with the service principal name MyApp/myApp.com, the display name My Application, and uses the supplied X509 certificate myapp.cer that is configured with a base 64 encoded asymmetric key.

## PARAMETERS

### -AccountEnabled
Specifies whether the account needs to be enabled.
The default value is $True.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: True
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Addresses
Specifies the of addresses used by the application.
Use the [New-MsolServicePrincipalAddresses](./New-MsolServicePrincipalAddresses.md) cmdlet to help create the Addresses list object.

```yaml
Type: RedirectUri[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AppPrincipalId
Specifies the unique application ID for a service principal in a tenant.
Once created, this property cannot be changed.
If you do not specify this parameter, the application ID is generated.

```yaml
Type: Guid
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisplayName
Specifies a display name of the service principal.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EndDate
Specifies the effective end date of the credential usage.
The default end date value is one year from today.

```yaml
Type: DateTime
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Today + 1 year
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ServicePrincipalNames
A list of service principal names (SPNs) associated with the service principal.

An SPN must be unique per company tenant and is used by an application to uniquely identify itself.
By default, the service principal **AppID** is always added as an SPN.
An SPN must use one of the following formats:
* `appName`
* `appName/hostname`
* a valid URL

AppName represents the name of the application and hostname represents the URI authority for the application.
When the service principal represents a WS-Federation relying party, an SPN can be set to a URL that would be treated as the WS-Federation wtrealm parameter.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: AppId of the service principal
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -StartDate
Specifies the effective start date of the credential usage.
The default start date value is today.

```yaml
Type: DateTime
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Today
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -TenantId
Specifies the unique ID of the tenant on which to perform the operation.
The default value is the tenant of the current user.
This parameter applies only to partner users.

```yaml
Type: Guid
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Type
Specifies the type of credential to use.
Valid values are: asymmetric, symmetric, and password.
* If asymmetric, the _Value_ parameter must be set to the public portion of a base 64 encoded X509 certificate.
* If symmetric, a 256 bit AES symmetric key will be generated if _Value_ is not set.
* If password, the _Value_ parameter must be specified and it should not be base 64 encoded.

The default setting is "symmetric".

```yaml
Type: ServicePrincipalCredentialType
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Symmetric
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Usage
Specifies the usage of the credential key.
The credential key usage can either be set to sign or verify a token.
The default setting is verify.

Sign is allowed ONLY for symmetric keys.
Verify is allowed for all key types.

A verify credential key is required by Azure Active Directory to verify that the request token was sent by your application, represented by this service principal.
Your application may optionally require that Azure Active Directory issue tokens to your application signed by using your signing key rather than the asymmetric public key identifying Azure Active Directory.
In this case, provide a sign credential key for your service principal.

```yaml
Type: ServicePrincipalCredentialUsage
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Verify
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Value
Specifies the value of the credential.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

## INPUTS

## OUTPUTS

### Microsoft.Online.Administration.ServicePrincipalExtended
This cmdlet returns the service principal that it added. This includes the following information:

* ObjectId. The unique identifier of the service principal.
* AppPrincipalId. The application identifier of the service principal.
* DisplayName. The friendly name of the service principal.
* ServicePrincipalName. The list of service principal names (SPNs) associated with the service principal.
* TrustedForDelegation. The value indicating if the service principal is allowed for delegation.
* AccountEnabled. The value indicating if the account is enabled.

It also retrieves the list of credentials that were added.
Each credential object contains the following information:

* Type. The type of service principal credential (Asymmetric/Symmetric/Other).
* Value. The value of the credential.
If the credential type is certificate, this represents the base 64 encoded certificate.
If credential type is symmetric, it represents an AES key.
* KeyGroupId. The identifier reserved for internal use.
* KeyId. The unique identifier of the key.

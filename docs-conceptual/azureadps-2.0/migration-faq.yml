      questions:
      - question: What happens to Azure AD PowerShell after March 30, 2024?
        answer: |          
          As of March 30, 2024, Azure AD, Azure AD Preview, and MS Online PowerShell modules are deprecated and support will only be offered for critical security fixes until March 30, 2025. As of May 30, 2025, MSOnline is retired.
          
      - question: What is Microsoft doing about the gaps in functionality between Azure AD and Microsoft Graph PowerShell modules?
        answer: |          
          We've been updating Microsoft Graph PowerShell to match the old modules. To help with migration, see the [cmdlet map](/powershell/microsoftgraph/azuread-msoline-cmdlet-map) of MSOnline and Azure AD PowerShell cmdlets to Microsoft Graph PowerShell. 

          The Microsoft Entra PowerShell module is also available, offering over 90% parity with Azure AD PowerShell. To help with migration, see the [cmdlet map](/powershell/entra-powershell/azuread-powershell-to-entra-powershell-mapping) of MSOnline and Azure AD PowerShell cmdlets to Microsoft Entra PowerShell..

      - question: What is Microsoft doing to improve the Microsoft Graph PowerShell user experience?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Graph PowerShell cmdlets are created automatically from the API schema and are always up to date. However, they might not be as easy to use as they're autogenerated. 
          
          We have build Microsoft Entra PowerShell to provide a more user-friendly experience, with cmdlets that are easier to use and understand. 
          [Microsoft Entra PowerShell](/powershell/entra-powershell/overview) is built on top of Microsoft Graph PowerShell, is fully operable with Microsoft Graph PowerShell, enabling you to perform complex operations with simple, well-documented cmdlets.
          
      - question: How is Microsoft going to support users who are migrating from Azure AD and MSOnline PowerShell modules?
        answer: |          
          Microsoft has invested significant effort into the Microsoft Graph PowerShell and Microsoft Entra PowerShell modules to provide feature parity with the retiring Azure AD and MSOnline modules. These modules are regularly updated to address gaps and improve the migration experience.

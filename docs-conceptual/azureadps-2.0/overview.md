# Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph

Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph (Azure AD PowerShell) is a module IT Pros commonly use to manage their Azure Active Directory. The cmdlets in the Azure AD PowerShell module enable you to retrieve data from the directory, create new objects in the directory, update existing objects, remove objects, as well as configure the directory and its features.

For more information about, or for the syntax of, any of the cmdlets, use the `Get-Help <cmdlet name>` command, where `<cmdlet name>` is the name of the cmdlet that you want to research.
For more detailed information, you can run any of the following commands:

* `Get-Help <cmdlet name> -Detailed`
* `Get-Help <cmdlet name> -Examples`
* `Get-Help <cmdlet name> -Full`

If you are developing new PowerShell scripts with Azure AD cmdlets we advise you to use the newer [Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph cmdlets](/powershell/module/azuread?view=azureadps-2.0&preserve-view=true). 

Refer to the modules below for a full list of cmdlets and their functionality.
